# HMCR

As part of the Highway Maintenance Contract Renewal (HMCR) process the business area defined the reporting requirements for the Maintenance Contractors (MCs). The contracts outlined the fields that have to be reported on and the format that it needs to be reported in.

This presents a problem on how to best collect the data being provided by the MCs and ensure its quality, so that it can be put to use for the Program and Ministry needs. Through this project the program wants to meet the need to automate the data gathering, as well as data validation process then capture the successfully validated data in a database which can then be immediately available to HQ and District Offices.
